# Finance tracker

I built this app using RoR.

Features of the app:

* Authentication system (devise) + edit profile
* Users can track stocks (up to 10 per user)
* Users can search for stocks, add and remove them from their portfolio
* Users can look up friends, using names or emails
* Users can see their friends' portfolio for investing ideas
* The app is mobile responsive
